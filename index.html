                <h2>HİSTORY</h2>
                <p class="date" id="datee">10.10.2018</p>

                    <strong> Metallica is an American heavy metal band. The band was formed in 1981 in Los Angeles by vocalist/guitarist James Hetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich, and has been based in San Francisco for most of its career.</strong> The group's fast tempos, instrumentals and aggressive musicianship made them one of the founding "big four" bands of thrash metal, alongside Megadeth, Anthrax and Slayer. Metallica's current lineup comprises founding members and primary songwriters Hetfield and Ulrich, longtime lead guitarist Kirk Hammett and bassist Robert Trujillo. Guitarist Dave Mustaine (who went on to form Megadeth after being fired from the band) and bassists Ron McGovney, Cliff Burton (who died in a bus accident in Sweden in 1986) and Jason Newsted are former members of the band.

                        Metallica earned a growing fan base in the underground music community and won critical acclaim with its first five albums.[3] The band's third album, Master of Puppets (1986), was described as one of the heaviest and most influential thrash metal albums. Its eponymous fifth album, Metallica (1991), the band's first to root predominantly in heavy metal, appealed to a more mainstream audience, achieving substantial commercial success and selling over 16 million copies in the United States to date, making it the best-selling album of the SoundScan era. After experimenting with different genres and directions in subsequent releases, the band returned to its thrash metal roots with the release of its ninth album, Death Magnetic (2008), which drew similar praise to that of the band's earlier albums.

                        In 2000, Metallica led the case against the peer-to-peer file sharing service Napster, in which the band and several other artists filed lawsuits against the service for sharing their copyright-protected material without consent; after reaching a settlement, Napster became a pay-to-use service in 2003. Metallica was the subject of the acclaimed 2004 documentary film Some Kind of Monster, which documented the sometimes troubled production of the band's eighth album, St. Anger (2003), and the internal struggles within the band at the time. In 2009, Metallica was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The band wrote the screenplay for and starred in the 2013 IMAX concert film Metallica: Through the Never, in which the band performed live against a fictional thriller storyline.

                        Metallica has released ten studio albums, four live albums, a cover album, five extended plays, 37 singles and 39 music videos. The band has won nine Grammy Awards from 23 nominations, and its last six studio albums (beginning with Metallica) have consecutively debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. Metallica ranks as one of the most commercially successful bands of all time, having sold over 125 million albums worldwide as of 2018.[4] Metallica has been listed as one of the greatest artists of all time by magazines such as Rolling Stone, which ranked them at no. 61 on its 100 Greatest Artists of All Time list.[5] As of 2017, Metallica is the third best-selling music artist since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking sales in 1991,[6] selling a total of 58 million albums in the United States.[7]

                <h2>Master of Puppets and Burton's death (1986–1987)</h2>
                <p class="date">05.01.1999</p>

                <p class="blog-text">
                    Metallica's third studio album, Master of Puppets, was recorded at Sweet Silence Studios and was released in March 1986. The album reached number 29 on the Billboard 200 and spent 72 weeks on the chart.[32] It was the band's first album to be certified gold on November 4, 1986, and was certified six times platinum in 2003.[33] Steve Huey of AllMusic considered the album "the band's greatest achievement".[34] Following the release of the album, Metallica supported Ozzy Osbourne on a U.S. tour.[30] Hetfield broke his wrist while skateboarding; he continued with the tour, performing vocals, with guitar technician John Marshall playing rhythm guitar.[35]
                    <p class="blog-text">
                        On September 27, 1986, during the European leg of Metallica's Damage, Inc. Tour, members drew cards to determine which bunks on the tour bus they would sleep in. Burton won and chose to sleep in Hammett's bunk. At around sunrise near Dörarp, Sweden, the bus driver lost control and skidded, which caused the bus to overturn several times. Ulrich, Hammett, and Hetfield sustained no serious injuries; however, bassist Burton was pinned under the bus and died. Hetfield said:

                    <p class="blog-text">
                        Jason Newsted joined Metallica soon after Cliff Burton's death in 1986.
                        I saw the bus lying right on him. I saw his legs sticking out. I freaked. The bus driver, I recall, was trying to yank the blanket out from under him to use for other people. I just went, 'Don't fucking do that!' I already wanted to kill the [bus driver]. I don't know if he was drunk or if he hit some ice. All I knew was, he was driving and Cliff wasn't alive anymore.[35]

                    <p class="blog-text">
                        Burton's death left Metallica's future in doubt. The three remaining members decided Burton would want them to carry on, and with the Burton family's blessings the band sought a replacement.[36] Roughly 40 people, including Hammett's childhood friend, Les Claypool of Primus, Troy Gregory of Prong, and Jason Newsted, formerly of Flotsam and Jetsam, auditioned for the band. Newsted learned Metallica's entire set list; after the audition Metallica invited him to Tommy's Joynt in San Francisco. Hetfield, Ulrich, and Hammett decided on Newsted as Burton's replacement; Newsted's first live performance with Metallica was at the Country Club in Reseda, California. The members initiated Newsted by tricking him into eating a ball of wasabi.[36]

                    <p class="blog-text">
                        After Newsted joined Metallica, the band left its El Cerrito practice space—a suburban house formerly rented by sound engineer Mark Whitaker dubbed "the Metalli-mansion"—and relocated to the adjacent cities of Berkeley and Albany before eventually settling in the Marin County city of San Rafael, north of San Francisco.[37][38]

                    <p class="blog-text">
                        Metallica finished its tour in the early months of 1987. In March 1987, Hetfield again broke his wrist while skateboarding, forcing the band to cancel an appearance on Saturday Night Live. In August 1987, an all-covers extended play (EP) titled The $5.98 E.P.: Garage Days Re-Revisited was released. The EP was recorded in an effort to use the band's newly constructed recording studio, test Newsted's talents, and to relieve grief and stress following the death of Burton. A video titled Cliff 'Em All commemorating Burton's three years in Metallica was released in 1987; the video included bass solos, home videos, and pictures.[39]

                <h2>METALLICA SHUT OUT OF 2018 GRAMMYS</h2>
                <p class="date">21.12.1981</p>

                <p class="blog-text">
                    Metallica were nominated for two Grammys this year, in the Best Rock Song and Best Rock Album categories. However, they failed to win in both categories.

                    Foo Fighters' "Run" beat out Metallica's "Atlas, Rise!" for best <mark> <del>rock song</del> </mark> . Metallica's Hardwired ... To Self-Destruct lost to War on Drugs' A Deeper Understanding for best rock album, a category that also included Queens of the Stone Age's Villains. Greg Kurstin also won producer of the year for work that included the Foo Fighters' Concrete and Gold. The announcements were made during the pre-show event, called the Premiere Ceremony.
                    <p class="blog-text">
                        <strong> Hardwired... to Self-Destruct</strong> , which earned Metallica their 22nd and 23rd Grammy nominations, arrived in November 2016. It was their first album since 2008's Death Magnetic, although in the interim they also released Lulu, a 2011 collaboration with Lou Reed, and Through the Never, the soundtrack to their 2013 concert film. In 2014, Metallica put out a standalone track, "Lords of Summer."

                        Tonight's official Grammy broadcast will kick off with a performance by U2 and fellow nominee Kendrick Lamar. Elton John was also set to take the stage with Miley Cyrus, just days after announcing his retirement from touring. The show, hosted by James Corden, airs at 7:30 ET on CBS.

                        Last week, Metallica announced that The $5.98 EP - Garage Days Re-Revisited, their 1987 EP, will be remastered and released on April 13. Although the record was expanded to a full-length in 1998 and called Garage, Inc., Metallica have now decided to restore it to the original format. You can pre-order The $5.98 EP reissue at the band's website.
